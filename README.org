#+title: Grothendieck - Development on Galois tooling with Stack

* Usage
- The =working= branch tracks a collection of submodule commits that can build [[https://github.com/GaloisInc/saw-script][saw-script]] and [[https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible][crucible]].
- From the =working= branch, set up =working= branches for each submodule in =galois/= too: =git submodule foreach 'git checkout -B working'=.
- Branch off of =working= in whichever submodule to develop.
* Plans
- Maybe use tags to allow development off of old states.
- Fix [[https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix][haskell.nix]] to build =sbv= properly, and use Nix / =cabal v2-repl= / Dante instead of Stack / Intero.
